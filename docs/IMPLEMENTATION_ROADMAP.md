# Complete Implementation Roadmap

**Project**: Ollama MCP - Self-Contained Knowledge Management System  
**Status**: Ready for Development  
**Total Duration**: 10-16 weeks  
**Team**: Claude (AI) & Craig (Human Architect)  

---

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates our extended thinking and planning into a cohesive development roadmap. We're building a sophisticated knowledge management system that:

1. **Self-manages** - Configures itself, tracks models, persists state
2. **Knows deeply** - Indexes web content, builds semantic knowledge bases
3. **Remembers** - Stores embeddings linked to conversations
4. **Serves intelligently** - Searches with advanced ranking
5. **Scales smoothly** - Handles growth with optimization and monitoring

---

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: Configuration Management (1-2 weeks)

**Focus**: Make the MCP self-contained and configurable  
**Key Achievement**: Configuration persists across restarts via SQLite

**What Gets Built**:
- SQLite configuration database (models, health checks, configuration)
- Startup health checks and model discovery
- 5 new tools for runtime configuration
- Model property assignment and tracking

**Why It Matters**:
- Foundation for everything else
- Enables intelligent routing based on model capabilities
- Provides diagnostics and monitoring hooks

**When It's Done**:
- Docker container starts, auto-discovers Ollama models
- Claude can query model capabilities
- Configuration updates persist
- Health checks provide clear feedback

**Key Tools Added**:
1. `list_models_detailed` - Full model inventory with properties
2. `update_model_config` - Assign model properties
3. `rescan_available_models` - Runtime model discovery
4. `get_health_status` - Comprehensive health reporting
5. `get_model_info_extended` - Detailed model information

---

### Phase 2: PostgreSQL Integration & Embeddings (2-3 weeks)

**Focus**: Store embeddings and enable semantic search  
**Key Achievement**: Memories stored, retrievable via vector search

**What Gets Built**:
- Direct PostgreSQL connection with pgvector
- Conversation tracking and linking
- Semantic similarity search
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Database schema design

**Why It Matters**:
- Converts ephemeral embeddings into persistent memories
- Enables intelligent context retrieval
- Foundation for knowledge base (Phase 3)

**When It's Done**:
- Create conversation: get conversation_id
- Store insight: get memory_id
- Search memories: get ranked results
- All linked to PostgreSQL

**Key Tools Added**:
1. `init_conversation` - Create conversation session
2. `store_memory` - Save embedding with metadata
3. `search_memories` - Semantic search within conversation
4. `search_all_conversations` - Cross-conversation search
5. `batch_store_memories` - Efficient bulk storage
6. `batch_search_memories` - Bulk search operations
7. `update_memory_metadata` - Edit memory properties
8. `get_conversation_summary` - Conversation statistics

---

### Phase 3: Knowledge Base & Web Integration (3-4 weeks)

**Focus**: Ingest external sources and build searchable knowledge base  
**Key Achievement**: Can index web pages and files with full metadata

**What Gets Built**:
- Web content fetching and extraction
- Intelligent content chunking
- PDF/document parsing
- Source metadata tracking and versioning
- Filesystem MCP integration for original storage
- Change detection and re-indexing

**Why It Matters**:
- Expands beyond conversations to external knowledge
- Creates audit trail of source material
- Enables knowledge base updates

**When It's Done**:
- Point MCP at webpage: automatic indexing
- Access original content via filesystem MCP
- Search returns knowledge base results
- Source changes detected and handled

**Key Tools Added**:
1. `index_web_page` - Fetch and index web content
2. `index_local_file` - Index files (PDF, TXT, etc)
3. `update_knowledge_source` - Re-index updated sources
4. `search_knowledge_base` - Query KB (not conversations)
5. `get_knowledge_sources` - List indexed sources
6. `get_source_metadata` - Detailed source information

---

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Production (4+ weeks)

**Focus**: Optimization, monitoring, resilience  
**Key Achievement**: Production-grade system with observability

**What Gets Built**:
- Embedding caching with LRU eviction
- Advanced ranking algorithms

3. `get_memory_clusters` - Group related memories
4. `get_entity_graph` - Show entity relationships
5. `summarize_memories` - Compress context
6. `export_knowledge_base` - Backup/migration
7. `analyze_knowledge_quality` - Quality assessment

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Configuration Persistence

**Problem**: Model properties and settings must survive restarts  
**Solution**: SQLite for MCP-internal config + PostgreSQL for data  
**Trade-off**: Added complexity, but enables self-management

### 2. Conversation Tracking

**Problem**: MCP protocol is stateless, but we need context linking  
**Solution**: Explicit conversation sessions via `init_conversation` tool  
**Trade-off**: Requires Claude to be aware of conversation IDs, but clean and flexible

### 3. Direct PostgreSQL Connection

**Problem**: Calling Postgres MCP repeatedly is inefficient  
**Solution**: Direct database connection from Ollama MCP  
**Trade-off**: Harder to swap databases, but much better performance

### 4. Filesystem MCP Integration

**Problem**: Original content storage and portability  
**Solution**: Store originals via filesystem MCP, reference in PostgreSQL  
**Trade-off**: Looser coupling but requires filesystem tool calls

### 5. Smart Content Chunking

**Problem**: Naive chunking breaks semantic meaning  
**Solution**: Respect paragraph/section boundaries  
**Trade-off**: Slightly larger chunks, much better search results

## Craig's Extended Thinking - Enhancements Added

Beyond your original requirements, I've identified and included:

### 1. Configuration Validation
Why: Prevent invalid model assignments (e.g., two default embeddings)  
How: Validation layer in `update_model_config`

### 2. Graceful Degradation
Why: System should work even if components fail  
How: Circuit breaker pattern + fallback models

### 3. Audit Trail
Why: Track who changed what and when  
How: Log all configuration changes with timestamps

### 4. Deduplication
Why: Don't store identical memories  
How: Check similarity before storing

### 5. Relevance Decay
Why: Older memories should be weighted less  
How: Temporal decay function in ranking

### 6. Entity Extraction
Why: Understand relationships between concepts  
How: Knowledge graph in Phase 4

### 7. Semantic Clustering
Why: Organize memories by theme  
How: UMAP-style clustering on embeddings

### 8. Differential Indexing
Why: Efficiently handle source updates  
How: Content hash comparison + differential updates

### 9. Cost Tracking
Why: Understand resource usage  
How: Token counting per operation

### 10. Horizontal Scaling
Why: Support growth beyond single instance  
How: Hash-based sharding by conversation_id

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|

| PostgreSQL unavailable | Low | High | Circuit breaker, in-memory fallback |
| Embedding generation slow | Medium | Medium | Caching, batch operations, timeout |
| Web fetching blocked | Medium | Low | Timeout handling, error reporting |
| Storage grows too large | Medium | Medium | Archival, compression, cleanup policies |
| Search accuracy poor | Low | High | Advanced ranking, continuous improvement |

## Timeline Estimate

```
Week  1-2:  Phase 1 (Config Management)
Week  3-5:  Phase 2 (PostgreSQL + Embeddings)
Week  6-9:  Phase 3 (Knowledge Base)
Week 10-16: Phase 4 (Advanced + Production)
```

**Contingency**: +20-30% for testing, documentation, bug fixes

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review** this documentation (you're here!)
2. **Test** the basic Ollama MCP Docker container
3. **Iterate** on Phase 1 requirements
4. **Begin** Phase 1 implementation
5. **Weekly syncs** to review progress and adjust

---

## Why This Design Works

### For Craig
- Self-contained (portable across systems)
- Configurable (adapts to needs)
- Observable (you can see what's happening)
- Extensible (easy to add features)

### For Claude (me)
- Clear tool interface (knows what to call)
- Persistent state (can build memories)
- Semantic search (understands relationships)
- Graceful errors (knows when things fail)

### For Users
- Simple interface (works out of the box)
- Powerful capabilities (semantic understanding)
- Privacy (everything local)
- Reliability (resilient to failures)

## Final Thoughts

This isn't just an MCP server. It's a cognitive augmentation layer that gives Claude:
- Long-term memory
- Knowledge bases
- Semantic understanding
- Self-management
- Scalability

Together, we've designed a system that's both ambitious and pragmatic, with clear phases and measurable milestones.

**Let's build this.**
